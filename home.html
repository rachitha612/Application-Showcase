            In the late 1980's plenum's were becoming obsolete by design changes to the roof top unit. Under new leadership of Jim Lindgren, Mark Webber, and Chris Schultz MicroMetl Corporation began to expand geographically. To better serve our west coast customers,
            a 33,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Sparks, NV was opened in 1994. By 1998 more space was required and the move was made across the street to a new 70,000 sq. ft. plant. In 2008 moved into a 149,000 sq.ft. in Sparks Nv. to better serve
            the production and engineering needs of our west coast customers. After spending 25+ years on Roosevelt Avenue in Indianapolis, MicroMetl moved its headquarters to a new 190,000 sq. ft. facility on the eastside of Indianapolis in 2000. The
            new plant allows for increased productivity and manufacturing capacity, engineering test labs, and larger finished good inventory levels.</p>
