<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>In 1965 the Booher family founded the company in Indianapolis as General Sheet Metal. GSM manufactured and installed sheet metal duct systems for the local construction market before venturing into HVAC accessory business. In May of 1992 the company was taken over by Gerald E. and Barbara E. Schultz who remain owners today.
</p><p>By the mid 1970s roof curbs and downturn plenums were being manufactured on a relatively small scale for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and regional distributors. The free-cooling concept of economizers was catching on, and HVAC distributors across the country were looking for someone to fill their accessory needs. With the leadership of Pat Booher, the engineering creativity of Don Fisher, and the nationwide marketing of the company by Bob Lawton, MicroMetl experienced significant growth in the 1980s. Innovative energy-efficient products and superior customer service led to MicroMetl being named as one of the Inc. 500 fastest growing small businesses in the U.S. for the years of 1983 and 1984.

<p>In the late 1980's plenum's were becoming obsolete by design changes to the roof top unit. Under new leadership of Jim Lindgren, Mark Webber, and Chris Schultz MicroMetl Corporation began to expand geographically.
To better serve our west coast customers, a 33,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Sparks, NV was opened in 1994. By 1998 more space was required and the move was made across the street to a new 70,000 sq. ft. plant. In 2008 moved into a 149,000 sq.ft. in Sparks Nv. to better serve the production and engineering needs of our west coast customers.
After spending 25+ years on Roosevelt Avenue in Indianapolis, MicroMetl moved its headquarters to a new 190,000 sq. ft. facility on the eastside of Indianapolis in 2000. The new plant allows for increased productivity and manufacturing capacity, engineering test labs, and larger finished good inventory levels.
Again in 2005 MicroMetl Corporation expanded to Longview Texas to be closer to our customers OEM locations. Our 108,000 sq. ft. facility services primarily OEM customers for factory installed accessories.</p>
